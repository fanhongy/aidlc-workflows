// t163 — REAPER STEAL mutual-exclusion PROPERTY test under REAL spawn contention.
// Mechanism: cli (process-boundary). This is the spawn-contention coverage the
// Stage B review flagged as MISSING for the reaper (t161 covers only the
// SEQUENTIAL, in-process invariants; nothing exercised the dead-lock reclaim
// under genuine multi-process contention). It is the closure for the review's
// concurrency-coverage debt — NOT a pre-fix↔post-fix discriminator (see HONESTY).
//
// WHY CLI (process-boundary, not in-process): the subject IS concurrency — the
// reaper steal (aidlc-lib.ts reapStaleLock) only fires when independent OS
// processes race to reclaim the SAME stale lock dir. bun:test runs serially
// inside one process, so an in-process loop could never overlap two reapers'
// decide→steal windows. This twin adds the missing real-concurrency dimension.
//
// THE INVARIANT WITH TEETH: seed ONE stale (dead-PID) lock, fire N processes that
// each try a single 0-retry acquire. The reaper is mutually exclusive: EXACTLY
// ONE process reclaims + acquires, reporting the seeded owner's PID; the winner
// then HOLDS (stays alive). Spawn-to-acquire latency is unbounded, so a contender
// may legitimately arrive after that winner exits and report a dead real-PID
// predecessor. Those serial-chain wins are allowed. A winner that reports its
// predecessor was STILL ALIVE after the steal robbed a live holder and fails the
// invariant. Repeated over GENERATIONS for stability.
//
// HONESTY (read before trusting this as a FIX-3 regression test): empirically
// this assertion holds on BOTH the pre-fix reaper (the prior "re-read stamp then
// rename" guard) AND a fully-NAIVE reaper (no re-check at all) — because for the
// DEAD-lock case the renameSync of the lock dir is itself the OS-atomic arbiter:
// only one process moves a given dir, the losers get ENOENT. The specific steal-
// race the CAS closes (a competitor re-mkdir'ing at the SAME path between a
// reaper's stale DECISION and its rename) is a sub-microsecond window that does
// NOT reproduce under spawn timing — verified by stress (24 procs × 40 gens, zero
// double-steals on the pre-fix code). So this test does NOT fail against pre-fix;
// it is a mutual-exclusion PROPERTY guard that would catch a GROSS reaper
// regression (e.g. dropping the mkdir/rename arbitration). The CAS fix is
// defense-in-depth for the unobservable window, documented in reapStaleLock.
//
// SOURCE UNDER TEST (dist/claude/.claude/tools/aidlc-lib.ts):
//   reapStaleLock — CAS steal (rename-first, verify-moved-stamp, restore-on-miss).
//   acquireAuditLock — mkdir-or-reap loop that calls it.
//
// FIXTURE DISCIPLINE: a per-test temp project dir + a temp driver script, both
// rm-rf'd in afterEach. The lock dir lives under tmpdir() (auditLockDir) and is
// cleaned between generations. Nothing is written under tests/fixtures/**.

// the seeded sentinel and records its PID; each later winner reports the prior
// winner's real PID. After acquire, the winner resolves that predecessor before
// probing it with process.kill(pid, 0); probing the raw observation would revive
// the benign read/acquire race. Dead predecessors prove legitimate serial
// re-acquisition; an alive predecessor proves the winner robbed a live holder.
//
// A WINNER then SLEEPS (HOLD_MS) BEFORE exiting. The hold widens the observation
// window so an overlapping winner probes a predecessor that is still alive. It
