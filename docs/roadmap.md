# AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 - Roadmap

Status as of 2026-08-10.

- The current v2 version is **2.5.62** (`origin/v2` tip `18bcc468`). Version
  numbers describe the committed framework tree;
  they are not GitHub Releases.
- AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 is **GA**. The README announcement landed in #627 after
  the reviewer-as-verifier and three-role ensemble milestones shipped.
- Release publication is not yet aligned with the v2 branch: GitHub still marks
  `v1.0.1` as Latest, tracked by #635. Packaging and release distribution are
  being reconsidered in #722.

The version numbers below describe where work landed on the v2 branch. Future
themes and open pull requests are directional, not committed release promises.

## North star reference

The seven functional goals of the AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 North Star, verbatim in intent:

1. **Mimic what we practice in the real world** - a stage executed by a
   configurable ensemble (Owner, Collaborator, Verifier) with consistent
   semantics across harnesses.
2. **Customization of behaviour** - encode new behaviours, policies, or
   constraints in no more than two targeted changes, reusable across harnesses
   without tool-specific rewrites.
3. **Adaptiveness of workflows** - scale in (report triage to compact Fix, Test,
   PR) and scale out (decide next stages at boundaries); composition not
   hard-wired.
4. **Verifier as a true adversary** - adversarial quality gate; may use a
   different LLM than the producer; validates against machine-checkable
   evidence; budgeted self-heal loop escalating to HITL.
5. **Support for cyclic, directional flows** - forward progression plus
   governed, directional feedback loops.
6. **Preserve artefact traceability** - downstream stages enrich upstream
   artefacts rather than spawning disconnected ones.
7. **Organizational, not project-local, artefact repository** - shared org
   knowledge layer across projects, intents, and repos; six named scenarios.

## Strategic delivery pillars

Two strategic pillars shape how the North Star reaches users and evolves:

- **Productization and distribution (#722)** - make AI-DLC straightforward to
  install, configure, upgrade, release and roll back across supported harnesses.
- **Plugin ecosystem and marketplace (#723)** - make trusted extensions
  discoverable, installable and reusable, with a clear path from external plugin
  to first-party capability.

## Directional themes

These themes are supported by open RFCs, issues or implementation pull requests,
but do not yet have committed release versions.

### Traceability and progressive enrichment

- Enforce per-stage upstream traceability
  ([#401](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/401)), bind review
  evidence to source state
  ([#646](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/646)), and propagate
  stale stage results
  ([#716](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/716)).
- Define per-unit attribution for Code Generation review receipts
  ([#662](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/662)) and a fresh v2
  implementation for cross-unit discovery propagation
  ([#299](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/299)/[#300](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/300)).
- Preserve progressive enrichment as the North Star destination: downstream
  stages enrich upstream artefacts in place, with ADRs as a core design artefact.
- Commit-level provenance remains an open design question; the current audit
  chain does not provide a durable reverse lookup from an arbitrary source commit
  to its intent and workflow.

### Governed feedback loops

- [#616](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/616) implements one
  bounded Build & Test to Code Generation return path for
  [#611](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/611). It is an
  incremental loop, not a general cyclic graph engine.
- General cross-stage backward edges still need engine-level governance, stale
  artefact handling and explicit human authorization.

### Plugins and marketplace

- The plugin mechanism, content projection, selection and plugin-contributed
  scopes are shipped.
- Remote discovery, trust, a first-party marketplace and a graduation path are
  proposed in [#723](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/723).
  Product discovery
  ([#652](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/652)) and design
  ([#527](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/527)) are candidates
  for first-party plugins.

### Knowledge and documents

- [#714](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/714) defines
  DocumentKB and [#731](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/731)
  implements its first indexing slice.
- [#694](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/694) proposes auditable
  supplemental-knowledge selection and delivery across stage topologies.

### Product discovery

- Core Ideation delivery remains under review in
  [#526](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/526), with an
  external-handover contract in
  [#586](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/586) and a
  plugin-shaped alternative in
  [#652](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/652).
- The delivery surface, core versus first-party plugin, is not yet settled.

### Installation, upgrades and releases

- [#722](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/722) covers binary
  packaging, installers, npm, release automation, rollback and post-install
  setup. [#399](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/399) tracks the
  hard Bun dependency.
- [#636](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/636) tracks a
  first-class upgrade contract. The earlier implementation PR
  [#535](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/535) closed without
  merging.
- [#635](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/635) tracks the
  mismatch between the v2 GA announcement and GitHub's Latest release still
  pointing at `v1.0.1`.

### Harness expansion and parity

- GitHub Copilot support shipped in
  [#657](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/657); its RFC
  [#472](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/472) still needs
  reconciliation.
- Cursor support is open in
  [#661](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/661), and Kiro IDE-native
  surfaces remain open in
  [#653](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/653).
- Antigravity setup is proposed in
  [#690](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/690).

### Evaluation and operations

- [#684](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/684) proposes
  repeatable benchmarks for measuring AI-DLC outcomes;
  [#223](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/223) tracks automated
  harness evaluation, initially for Claude Code and Kiro.
- Operations-phase steering remains a requested direction
  ([#221](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/221),
  [#473](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/473)), not an active
  v2 implementation stream.

## Known gaps

- Stage-specific rules (`aidlc-stage-<slug>.md`) are reserved but unbuilt.
- Plugin `when:` evaluation, remote discovery and marketplace trust remain open.
- Sensor failures are advisory; blocking severity remains open in #431.
- General cross-stage cycles and progressive in-place artefact enrichment remain
  North Star gaps.
- Kiro IDE issue #543 is closed, but #555/#653 still track native agent/settings
  surfaces.
- Several older community PRs remain open and need rebasing or disposition:
  #401-#404, #526 and #553. PRs #432, #535 and #552 closed without merging.
- The Copilot RFC #472 and deterministic ARS issue #618 remain open despite their
  implementations shipping in #657 and #644; their issue state should be
  reconciled.
