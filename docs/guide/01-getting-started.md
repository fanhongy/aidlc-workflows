# Getting Started

This chapter walks you through installing this implementation, verifying your environment, and preparing for your first workflow.

> **Note**: This chapter's walkthrough shows **Claude Code**. AI-DLC also runs
> on Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE, Codex CLI, and opencode: the methodology is identical
> on every harness, but prerequisites, configuration, and some surfaces (the
> welcome banner, the statusline) are not. Step 1 of
> [Installation](#installation) below installs the native runtime for every harness;
> everything else that differs lives in your harness's chapter under
> [Running on other harnesses](harnesses/README.md).

---

## Prerequisites

The recommended native AI-DLC runtime does not require Bun, Node.js, or Git.
Your chosen harness still has its own prerequisites (for example, Codex project
hook discovery requires a Git repository):

| Prerequisite | Purpose | Install |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | This implementation runs as a Claude Code command. The orchestrator, agents, and hooks all execute within Claude Code. | Native install (recommended, auto-updates): macOS/Linux/WSL `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash`; Windows PowerShell `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 \| iex`. Or `brew install --cask claude-code`. ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart)) |
| **bun** | Required only by the source/development copy channel, whose tools and hooks remain TypeScript. The native installer and native project runtime do not use it. | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash` ([docs](https://bun.sh)). On Windows: `npm install -g bun` or `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 \| iex"` |

> **Copy installs only**: `bun` must be on your `PATH` for non-interactive
> shells. Claude Code runs your shell non-interactively, so it sources
> `~/.zshenv` (zsh) or `~/.bashrc` (bash), not `~/.zshrc`. Native installs use
> the `aidlc` executable instead.

Verify prerequisites:

```bash
command -v claude >/dev/null && echo "✓ Claude Code installed" || echo "✗ Install Claude Code first"
# Source/development copy channel only:
command -v bun    >/dev/null && echo "✓ bun installed"          || echo "✗ Install bun before copying dist/claude"
```

## AWS Bedrock Setup

This implementation ships configured for **AWS Bedrock**. The shipped `.claude/settings.json` sets:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | `1` | Routes Claude Code through Bedrock |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Bedrock region — **required**; Claude Code does not read it from `~/.aws`. Override per-region (see below). |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-fable-5[1m]` | Fable alias for users who opt into `fable`/`fable[1m]` |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8[1m]` | Orchestrator model (used at `opus[1m]`, the 1M-context variant) |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]` | Subagent model |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` | Background/fast tasks (no `[1m]`: Haiku 4.5 is a 200K model with no 1M variant) |

These model pins use global Bedrock inference profile IDs (the `global.` prefix). The `[1m]` suffix on the Fable, Opus, and Sonnet pins selects the 1M-context variant — so tier-pinned subagents (not just the `opus[1m]` orchestrator) get the 1M window; Claude Code strips the suffix before the model ID reaches Bedrock. You still need to do the AWS-account-side setup once.

### One-time AWS account setup (manual path)

1. **Enable Anthropic model access.** In the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), open the **Model catalog**, select each Anthropic model you'll use (Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), and submit the use-case form. Access is granted immediately. This is required once per AWS account before any model can be invoked. (AWS Organizations can submit once from the management account; approval extends to child accounts.)

2. **Attach the IAM permissions** your role/user needs to invoke models and resolve inference profiles:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "AllowModelAndInferenceProfileAccess",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "bedrock:InvokeModel",
           "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
           "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
           "bedrock:GetInferenceProfile"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:inference-profile/*",
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:application-inference-profile/*",
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:foundation-model/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Provide AWS credentials.** Claude Code uses the default AWS SDK credential chain. Any one of:

   ```bash
   aws configure                         # static access key / secret
   # — or — an SSO profile:
   aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
   export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>
   # — or — credentials already exported in your environment (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.)
   ```

   Keep secrets out of the shared `settings.json`. Put `AWS_PROFILE` (or other env you don't want to leak) in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) instead.

4. **Set your region** if it isn't `us-east-1`. The shipped default is `us-east-1`; override it without editing shared config:

   ```bash
   cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
   # then add  "AWS_REGION": "<your-region>"  to the env block
   ```

   `settings.local.json` takes precedence over `settings.json`. Confirm the model is available in your region with `aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region <your-region>`.

> **Easier path:** instead of the manual steps above, run `claude`, choose **3rd-party platform → Amazon Bedrock** at the login prompt, and the wizard detects your credentials, region, and accessible models and writes them to your user settings. Re-run `/setup-bedrock` any time to change them. You still complete step 1 (model access) once in the console.

For the authoritative, always-current setup — IAM detail, SSO refresh, inference profiles, troubleshooting — see the AWS guide: **[Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock: Quick Setup Guide](https://community.aws/content/2tXkZKrZzlrlu0KfH8gST5Dkppq/claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock-quick-setup-guide)** and the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## MCP Servers (optional)

This implementation declares its MCP servers in `.mcp.json` at the project root (beside `.claude/`). Claude Code provisions them to the session, and every AI-DLC agent inherits all of them — so any agent can reach any declared server with no per-agent grant. The shipped `.mcp.json` declares five MCP servers:

| Server | Provides | Transport | Credentials |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `context7` | Library/SDK documentation lookups | HTTP | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` from your environment |
| `aws-mcp` | AWS API access | `uvx` (`mcp-proxy-for-aws@latest`, `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`) | Standard AWS credential chain |
| `aws-pricing` | AWS pricing queries | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-pricing-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-iac` | Infrastructure-as-code tooling | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-serverless` | Serverless tooling | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |

### Prerequisites

The four AWS servers launch through `uvx`. Install `uv`/`uvx` once:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

`context7` is an HTTP server and needs no local install. To use it, export an API key:

```bash
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

Put `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` (and any other secret env) in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) rather than the shared `settings.json`. `.mcp.json` itself carries only the env-var placeholder — no secrets are committed.

### What becomes available

The four AWS servers authenticate with the same default AWS SDK credential chain Claude Code already uses for Bedrock (see [AWS Bedrock Setup](#aws-bedrock-setup)). Once `uvx` is installed and AWS credentials resolve, those servers come up automatically; `context7` comes up once `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is set. Because the servers are inherited at the session level, every agent reaches every declared server — there is no per-agent grant to perform.

> **Restricting an agent (advanced):** inheritance is additive — declaring a server makes it available to all agents, and you cannot grant servers per-agent. To *prevent* a specific agent from using a server, narrow that agent's `tools:` allowlist to the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids it may call (a bare `mcp__<server>` token is not honoured). See [Agents](06-agents.md) for how agent tool access works.

### Not using these?

Missing credentials are not blocking. A server you have no credentials for — no AWS chain, no `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` — is simply unavailable; the workflow runs without it and never stalls waiting on it. To drop a server entirely, remove its entry from `.mcp.json`.

## Installation

The recommended path installs a checksum-verified native executable and every
harness runtime, then `aidlc config` selects the project harness.

### Step 1: Install the native runtime

On macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | bash
```

The installer verifies the release manifest, native executable, and all-harness
runtime archive against the published SHA-256 checksums before installation. The
installed AI-DLC runtime has no Bun, Node.js, or Git dependency; Codex project
hook discovery still requires the target project to be a Git repository.

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP install-aidlc.ps1
irm https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer
```

The installer places a stable `aidlc.cmd` under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\bin` and verifies the same checksums.

For an air-gapped package, use
`install.sh --from <release-directory> --offline` or
`install.ps1 -From <release-directory> -Offline`. Pass
`--profile "$HOME/.profile"` to the Unix installer only when it should add its
marked PATH block; profiles are not edited by default.

### Step 2: Initialize the project

Run config from the project root:

```bash
cd your-project
aidlc config
aidlc doctor
```

`aidlc config` is offline. It writes the harness tree and workspace shell, safely
merges the distribution's declared root integrations, and records ownership
hashes plus the project runtime version. On Claude Code it asks whether to add
the optional shipped MCP servers; use `aidlc config --mcp none` or
`aidlc config --mcp defaults` to make that choice explicit. Use
`aidlc config --dry-run` to preview every create, update, merge, preserve, remove,
or conflict action.

Continue with the next step for the selected harness:

| Harness | After `aidlc config` | Native trust behavior |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Claude Code | Open Claude Code in the project, then run `/aidlc --doctor`. | The projected settings allow `Bash(aidlc engine *)`; hooks and the statusline call the installed command. |
| Kiro CLI | Run `kiro-cli chat`, then `/aidlc --doctor`. | The workspace selects the `aidlc` agent by default and permits its `aidlc engine *` engine calls. |
| Kiro IDE | Open the project in Kiro IDE, then run `/aidlc --doctor`. | Config merges `aidlc engine *` into `kiroAgent.trustedCommands` without replacing other `.vscode/settings.json` keys. |
| Codex CLI | In a Git repository, run `codex`, approve the hook trust dialog, then `$aidlc --doctor`. | Codex requires one trust action: approve interactively or merge the generated `.codex/trust-seed.toml` entries into `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`. |
| opencode | Run `opencode`, then `/aidlc --doctor`. | The projected `opencode.json` allows direct `aidlc engine *` calls; other shell commands still prompt. |

### Refresh and version skew

`aidlc update` changes the machine runtime only; it does not rewrite projects.
`aidlc doctor` compares each project's version stamp with the selected engine
and reports skew. Refresh a project between workflows:

```bash
aidlc config --dry-run
aidlc config
```

Refresh uses the recorded ownership baseline to update framework-owned files,
merge managed root blocks/maps/arrays, preserve user-owned content, and report
locally modified framework files as conflicts. It refuses to refresh while any
workflow is active because stage and graph definitions may have changed.
Complete the workflow before rerunning config. `aidlc update` and
`aidlc use` remain safe during a workflow because they do not touch
project files.

### Source/development copy alternative

The committed `dist/<harness>/` trees remain available for framework
development and source-based installs. This channel requires a repository clone,
Git, and Bun; its hooks and tools run the projected TypeScript files. It does
not use `aidlc config` because the copied tree already contains the workspace
shell.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows.git
cd aidlc-workflows
git checkout v2
```

merging `opencode.json`.

## The Workspace Shell

For a native install, `aidlc config` creates the workspace shell and its refresh
baseline before the first harness session. It does not create a workflow intent
and never uses the network.

For a source/development copy install, there is no scaffold step. The
distribution you copied already ships the
workspace shell — the `.claude/` engine plus a pre-built `aidlc/spaces/default/`
holding the memory layer (`aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`, where team-affirmed
practices and learnings live). You do not run any config command.

The first time you run `/aidlc` (or describe what to build), the engine
**auto-births** the first intent into the active space. Each intent gets its own
record dir at `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`, which holds:

- `aidlc-state.md` — the per-intent workflow state
- `audit/` — the audit trail, written as per-clone shards (`<host>-<clone>.md`)
- `<phase>/<stage>/...` — the stage artifacts (e.g. `inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`)

Team knowledge lives one level up, at the space level —
`aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/` (a sibling of `intents/`) — so it accumulates
across every intent in the space. The engine creates it empty; you add free-form
files under an optional `aidlc-shared/` and per-agent subdirectories.

To add [team knowledge](08-knowledge.md) or team practices before your first run,
edit the shipped `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` files; the space-level
`aidlc/knowledge/` directory is created (empty) once your first `/aidlc` runs.

For the full picture of the workspace layout — how it holds many intents at once,
what spaces are for, and the commands to move between them — see
[Spaces and Intents](03-spaces-and-intents.md).

## Verify the Setup

Run the health check to confirm everything is in place:

```
/aidlc --doctor
```

`--doctor` exits 0 when every check passes and 1 when any check fails; the full report writes to stdout in both cases.

### What `--doctor` checks

| Check | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| Prerequisites | Self-contained binary, or `bun` installed and on `$PATH` for copy installs |
| Installed runtime | Active machine version and complete all-harness runtime for binary installs |
| Project stamp | Project distribution/version compared with the selected engine |
| Hook presence | All 17 framework hook sources exist in `.claude/hooks/`: the statusline source plus the other 16 wired through the `settings.json` `hooks` block. A wired-but-missing hook fails loudly; sourcing the expected roster from settings means adding a hook there auto-checks it. |
| Project structure | `.claude/settings.json` exists with expected configuration |
| Workspace shell | `.claude/` + `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` are present (the shipped shell) |
| State file | the active intent's `aidlc-state.md` matches its audit trail (no drift) |
| Hook heartbeats | `.aidlc-hooks-health/` contains recent timestamps from hook executions |
| Graph integrity | No cycles in `stage-graph.json`; every slug has a matching stage file |
| Scope validation | All 9 scopes walk cleanly against the graph (advisories for scope-truncation gaps are expected) |
| Schema + references | Every stage's YAML frontmatter validates, and every consumes/requires_stage reference resolves |
| Keyword overlap | No keyword is claimed by more than one scope across the `.claude/scopes/*.md` files |
| Pending-compose marker | Reports a present `aidlc/.aidlc-compose-pending` (the in-flight compose gate marker) with its age. Fresh (under 24h, the normal state at an open compose gate) passes as advisory; stale (a crashed compose gate stranded it) fails. Silent when absent. Remediation: delete it if no compose gate is pending, or resolve the gate |

### Example copy-install output

```
✓ bun installed (required for CLI tools and hooks)
✓ aidlc-audit-logger.ts present
✓ aidlc-sync-statusline.ts present
✓ aidlc-validate-state.ts present
✓ aidlc-log-subagent.ts present
✓ aidlc-session-start.ts present
✓ aidlc-session-end.ts present
✓ aidlc-statusline.ts present
✓ settings.json present
✓ AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE (unset — no project default)
✓ workspace shell ready (.claude/ + aidlc/spaces/default/memory/)
✓ Hook heartbeats: not yet fired (first workflow stage will populate)
✓ State matches last audit event (no drift)
✓ Cycle detection: 0 cycles
✓ Orphan stage files: 32 graph entries all have files
✓ Scope validation: 9 scopes valid (29 advisories)
✓ Schema validation: 32/32 stages valid
✓ Graph references: 122 artifacts + edges resolved
✓ Keyword overlap: no conflicts
```

### Fixing failures

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `bun` not installed | Source/development copy only: install via `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash`. On Windows, use `npm install -g bun` or `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 \| iex"`. Ensure it is on PATH for non-interactive shells. |
| Hook not present | Native: run `aidlc config` between workflows. Copy: re-copy the `.claude/` directory from the distribution. |
| `settings.json` missing | Native: run `aidlc config`. Copy: re-copy `dist/claude/.claude/settings.json`. |
| Workspace shell missing | Native: run `aidlc config`. Copy: re-copy the workspace shell from `dist/claude/` into the project root. |
| State file issues | Archive the active intent's record dir under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/` and run `/aidlc` to start fresh |
| Graph/scope/schema/keyword failures | The diagnostic reports the specific artifact, slug, or scope name at fault. These indicate authoring drift in `.claude/aidlc-common/stages/` or `.claude/scopes/`; regenerate the compiled graph + scope grid with `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-graph.ts compile` or inspect the named stage/scope directly. |

## Start Your First Workflow

Once `--doctor` passes, you are ready to run:

```
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

Or specify a scope directly:

```
/aidlc feature
/aidlc bugfix Fix the login timeout issue
```

See [Your First Workflow](02-your-first-workflow.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough of what happens next.

---

## Quick Reference

In your shell:

```bash
# Verify prerequisites
command -v claude >/dev/null && echo "✓ Claude Code" || echo "✗ Claude Code"
command -v bun    >/dev/null && echo "✓ bun"          || echo "✗ bun"

# From your aidlc-workflows clone (v2 branch) - see Installation above
# Install (engine + the workspace shell sibling)
cp -r dist/claude/.claude/ your-project/.claude/
cp -r dist/claude/aidlc/   your-project/aidlc/

# Launch Claude Code in your project
cd your-project && claude
```

Inside the Claude Code session:

```
# Verify (exits 1 on any check failure; read stdout for the full report)
/aidlc --doctor

# Start
/aidlc Build a task management API with user authentication
```

---

## Tool Permissions

The included `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves Claude Code tools (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, WebSearch) so workflows run without per-call permission prompts. Review this file before use and adjust to your security requirements.

See [Customization](13-customization.md) for details on modifying tool permissions.
